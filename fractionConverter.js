 *?            Mooooooooooooorning Jalysset , so our warmup today is one of the toy probelms we already did in the junior phase at RBK
 *?                             Write a function that takes a number as its argument and
 *?                         returns a string that represents that number's simplified fraction.
 *
 *?                                       Example: toFraction(0.5) === '1/2'
 *
 **                       Whole numbers and mixed fractions should be returned as irregular fractions
 *
 **                                  Example: toFraction(3.0) === '3/1'
 *
 **                                  Example: toFraction(2.5) === '5/2'
 *
 * 
 *!                                           Happy coding have fun
